# üìù Grammar Scoring Engine

A robust grammar scoring and correction engine that processes audio inputs, transcribes them, corrects grammatical errors, and evaluates the overall language quality using weighted linguistic metrics.

---

## üöÄ Overview

This project provides an end-to-end pipeline to:

- Convert audio input to text using automatic speech recognition (ASR)
- Correct grammatical errors in the transcription using a transformer-based model
- Evaluate the transcription based on:
  - BERTScore similarity
  - Word error rate
  - Sentence structure analysis
  - Grammatical complexity
- Generate a composite grammar score on a scale of 0 to 10

The system is designed to be used in applications like automated language evaluation, communication training, and educational feedback tools.

## üîç Key Features

- **Speech-to-Text:** Uses OpenAI's `whisper-small` model for ASR.
- **Grammar Correction:** Uses the `vennify/t5-base-grammar-correction` model via Happy Transformer.
- **Language Quality Scoring:** Combines multiple linguistic metrics with adjustable weights.
- **Error Penalty Adjustment:** Penalizes scores based on error rate and similarity thresholds.
- **Modular Pipeline:** Easily extensible and customizable.
